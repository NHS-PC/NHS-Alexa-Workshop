# A python program to demonstrate how to declare a function

# Functions in python are used to organize your code. It's a way to call a certain piece of
# code that you can name anything you want. Take the following example:

# All functions in python begin with 'def'. This just stands for 'definition', or that
# you're 'defining' a function.
def sayHello():
    print 'Hello World!'

# Here we call out function, and we tell it to run.
sayHello()

# Functions are how programmers organize their code, and it's how they are able to
# manipulate different pieces of a project. See the next example for a better
# example of what a function does.
