# Even more functions!

# An argument is something that a function takes in as input.

# In this example, the function takes in two variables, a and b, and then adds them up.
def addTwoNumbers(a,b):
    c = a+b
    return c

# Print the result of addTwoNumbers
print addTwoNumbers(1,2)

# Now, watch what happens once you put in a string.
